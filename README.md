showoff.js
==========

Porting [showoff][showoff] to [node][node].  It's written in [express][expressjs].

This is what I did during the first [node knockout][knockout].

Running
=======

    % node server.js

Setup
=====

This is designed to be run locally and shared with people at a conference.  The
person connecting from localhost drives everyone's experience with websockets. :)
